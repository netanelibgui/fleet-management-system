?? Personal Training Assistant – Overview & Technical Specification
?? Project Description
This project is a locally hosted personal coaching assistant, powered by an LLM, designed to provide reflective conversations, behavioral analysis, motivational nudges, and tailored micro-actions — all through WhatsApp.
It doesn’t aim to be a general chatbot — but a deeply personalized companion trained on your principles, tone, life context, and decision-making style.

?? Project Objectives
?? Core Goal
To create a mental and behavioral coaching agent that helps the user navigate daily challenges, thought loops, and habits — using natural language and a personal knowledge base of values, rules, and voice.

?? What Can This Agent Actually Do?
CapabilityDescription?? Open DialogueUnderstands emotional or situational input like “I feel stuck” and responds with reflections, clarity, or micro-tasks.?? Intent ClassificationDetects whether the message is emotional, practical, reflective, or task-oriented — and routes accordingly.? Task GenerationSuggests small, focused actions based on situation + user profile.?? Principle RecallDynamically pulls personal rules or values in context (“What do I believe about this?”).?? Timed Follow-upSaves a reminder or action and triggers it later via WhatsApp.?? Daily/Weekly ReviewOptionally prompts for “How was your day?” — then tracks patterns across time.
?? How It Works (Under the Hood)
?? Local LLM (Mistral / Phi-3 / LLaMA)
* Runs via Ollama or equivalent.
* Uses a persistent system prompt to lock tone, behavior, and rules.
* Supports a custom knowledge base for reasoning (via embeddings or context injection).
?? Personal Guidelines & Identity (Profile)
* Predefined by the user (you):
o Communication style
o Do's and don'ts
o Decision-making principles
o Trigger-based responses
o Reflection templates and reframing phrases
?? RAG-Based Reasoning
* Every message triggers a query into your custom knowledge (via embedding search)
* Resulting context is inserted into the LLM prompt
* Output feels deeply “you”
